The TSV files [sort-characters.tsv](sort-characters.tsv) and
[sort.tsv](sort.tsv) are tab-separated files which hold documentation on the
desired sort order. These need to be edited when requirements change.

Do not edit [sort-characters.txt](sort-characters.txt) or [sort.txt](sort.txt).
These files will be overwritten by the script [preprocess.py](preprocess.py).
Rerun ./preprocess.py each time after editing sort-characters.tsv or sort.tsv.

Shorter requirements for reverse, retrograde and reverse retrograde sorting are
in [sort-retrograde.txt](sort-retrograde.txt),
[sort-reverse-retrograde.txt](sort-reverse-retrograde.txt) and
[sort-reverse.txt](sort-reverse.txt).
